The value space of \"duration\" is a six-dimensional space in which the coordinates designate the Gregorian year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components as defined in ISO 8601. These components are ordered in their significance by their order of appearance as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. The lexical representation of duration is the extended format PnYnMnDTnHnMnS, where P is the flag for duration (i.e., Period) and is constant, nY represents the number of years, nM the number of months, nD the number of days, T is the date/time separator, nH the number of hours, nM the number of minutes and nS the number of seconds. The number of seconds can include decimal digits to arbitrary precision. For example, to indicate a duration of 1 year, 2 months, 3 days, 10 hours, and 30 minutes, one would write: \"P1Y2M3DT10H30M.\" An optional preceding minus sign (\"-\") is allowed, to indicate a negative duration: a duration of minus 120 days would be indicated as: \"-P120D\" (from: http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration).",

Start, end, and duration are documented using the designated DateTime structures. Examples: start/end 2018-02-22T13:00:00/2018-02-22T14:30:00; start/duration 2018-02-22T13:00:00/1H30M; duration/end 1H20M/2018-02-22T14:30:00. For start/end expressions, if any element is missing from the end value, it is assumed to be the same as for the start value, including the time zone if used. For example, a two-hour meeting on 14 Dec 2007 can be represented as 2007-12-14T13:30:00/15:30:00, or 2007-12-14T13:30:00/2H.",
